## Exercises
Please submit your answers to the following questions in a file called intro_to_clean_coding_answers.txt.

1. In your own words, explain what clean code is and why it is important.

A: We spend most of our time reading our code and code from others.
So use clean code is faster and easy to read and easy to maintain
reducing the time we need to spend on it.

2. Read this article about Toyota and their use of bad code. Although you may
not yet understand all of the topics discussed, think about another commonly
used object that relies on computers and explain what would happen if the code
was not created to an acceptable standard.

A: Una example is an ecommerce website, that if the payment method is not
secure or is not well built could charge another amount of money or,
the shipping method could send the package to a wrong customer.

3. Would you consider the following to be clean code? Explain why or
why not. If not, refactor the code.

FUNCTION do(x, y)               // Creating a new function
 IF y = "F" THEN               // Check if y is equal "F"
 SET z to (x−32) * (5/9)       // Formula to convert degrees fahrenheit to celsius
 PRINT z                       // Print result
 ELSE IF y = "C" THEN          // If y not equal to "F", check if equal to "C"
 SET z to x * 1.8000 + 32.00   // Formula to convert degrees celsius to fahrenheit
 PRINT z                       // Print result
 END IF
END FUNCTION

It's not clean code because is not appropiate nesting and is not following
the Squient Test because is difficult to find anything. Variable names don't explain well their purpose.

FUNCTION do(oldTemperature, temperatureType)               // Creating a new function
 IF temperatureType = "F" THEN               // Check if y is equal "F"
  SET newTemperature to (oldTemperature−32) * (5/9)       // Formula to convert degrees fahrenheit to celsius
  PRINT newTemperature                       // Print result
 ELSE IF temperatureType = "C" THEN          // If y not equal to "F", check if equal to "C"
  SET newTemperature to oldTemperature * 1.8000 + 32.00   // Formula to convert degrees celsius to fahrenheit
  PRINT newTemperature                       // Print result
 END IF
END FUNCTION
