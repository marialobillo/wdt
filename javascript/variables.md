### Questions

> What type of variable name casing do you use in JavaScript? (think of snakes or camels)

A: I use `let` for variables.

> If you want to create a variable called mentor and set its value equal to the name of your mentor, how would you do that?

A: `let mentor = 'Jacob' `

> How would you then log the value of mentor to the console?

A: `console.log(mentor);`

> Describe the difference between let, var, and const.

A: Let is for variable with scope, I prefer use that. Var is for global variable, don't recommend and const is for constants, variables that never change.

### Code Practice

> Using var, let and const create 3 variables that will hold your name, state, and hair color.

```
const name = "Maria";
let state = "single";
var hair_color = "brown";
```
