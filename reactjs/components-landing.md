## Exercises

> There are two front-end frameworks that compete with React: Angular and Vue.js. Research these alternative frameworks to identify the differences between the three (React, Angular, and Vue). In the checkpoint submission, explain the differences, list the pros and cons of each framework, and include links to reference articles to back up your assertions.

A: React is the king with 70% of the market, followed by Angular with 20% and Vuejs around 1%.

React Pros:
- Easy to learn.
- Hight level of flexibility
- The virtual DOM is much acceptable by web browsers.
- Combines ES6/7

- It's 100% Open Source
- Migration from old versions are very easy.

React Cons:
- Lack of official documentation.
- There's no a react way to do the things, so sometimes there are so many options for programmers.
- It's hard to master how to integrate user interface.

Angular Pros:
- Angular 5 is faster than previous versions
- Better official docs but takes time.
- Two-way data binding
- It has a MVVM, which means ModelView-ViewModel

Angular Cons:
- The complex syntax from Angularjs, the first version.
- Angular uses Typescript
- Migration issues from older versions

Vuejs Pros:
- Good documentation
- Easy to migrate from others frameworks
- At large scale, vuejs can help to develop pretty large reusable templates
- Tiny size, only 20KB

Vuejs Cons:
- Lack of resources, still has a pretty small market
- Sometimes vuejs has issues of integration into huge projects
- A lot of elements and description are in Chinese, not in English.
